# Rossman Sales: Forecasting sales using Machine Learning

## Rossman Overview

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

This project aim to predict sales using data from Rossman, using Data Science lifecycle process like:

## The CRISP-DM Cicle for Data Science

For this project, we will use  **CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** method, a process model with six phases that naturally describes the data science life cycle. It’s like a set of guardrails to help you plan, organize, and implement your data science (or machine learning) project.

Business understanding – *What does the business need?*
Data understanding – *What data do we have / need? Is it clean?*
Data preparation – *How do we organize the data for modeling?*
Modeling – *What modeling techniques should we apply?*
Evaluation – *Which model best meets the business objectives?*
Deployment – *How do stakeholders access the results?*
